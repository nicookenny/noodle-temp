## New contributor guide

Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)

- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)

- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)

- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

## Getting your foot in

Our preferred way of providing the opportunity for people to contribute to Noodle is through a process that starts with creating a new issue, the summary of the workflow that you can expect and should adhere to is the following:

- You see an area of improvement in the code base, this could be a fix, feature, refactoring...etc

- Create an [issue](https://github.com/ixahmedxi/noodle/issues) on our Github repository.

- Wait until a team member discusses the issue with you, and if both parties are in agreement, you can assign yourself to the issue.

- Start working on the issue, creating a draft pull request and remembering to link your pull request with the issue.

- Once the work is complete, change the status of the pull request to ready for review.

- We will review the pull request and if all is good, congratulations! ðŸ¥³ you are now a Noodle contributor!

- If not, we will explain the changes that need to be made for the pull request to be merged.

If you would like to be more involved in the development of Noodle, we would like to invite you to our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/SERySfj8Eg) where we can have a chat together and get you involved in the project!

### Some simple rules

- Don't work on an issue that has already been assigned to someone else.

- Don't work on something without getting a team member's approval, this is to not waste your time by making you work on something that won't be merged.

- Don't demand for your pull request to be approved and merged.

- Be nice to everyone involved, we are aiming to create a positive community around collaborating and contributing towards Noodle's development.

## The tech stack

The Environment:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

There are a lot of other technologies being used in this project, however these are the most important and influential bits of it.

## Getting stuff running

### Cloning the repo

To clone the repo, you firstly need to [fork](https://github.com/ixahmedxi/noodle/fork) it, and then clone your copy of noodle locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-gh-username>/noodle.git
```

### Volta

To get the project running locally, it is advised that you have [Volta](https://volta.sh/) installed on your system. This allows you to have the exact same versions of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) and [Pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as we do, further lowering the chances of you getting errors that we don't get.

There are ways to do this using other tools such as NVM, but we take Noodle as an initiative to move people to arguably better tools such as Volta.

Volta's pnpm support is currently experimental, and so you need to do the following to let it manage your Pnpm version:

In your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file, add the following line:

```bash
export VOLTA_FEATURE_PNPM=1
```

With this out of the way, you should have the correct version of Nodejs and Pnpm once you change directory into Noodle's project folder. You can test this out as such:

```bash
# cd into noodle
cd /path/to/noodle

# output node and pnpm versions
node --version
pnpm --version
```

And make sure that the version is the same as the one defined in the root `package.json` file in the `volta` section.

### Environment Variables

Now that Volta has been installed locally on your system, it's time to configure your environment variables so that the project works as expected:

1.  Duplicate the `.env.example` file as just `.env`

2.  Populate the values with your own

#### Configuring your Database

At Noodle, we are using Turso as our production database, but since this is based on Sqlite, it makes it very easy to run things locally, all you need to have a local DB working is the following in the `.env` file:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
```

This will create a local file in the root of the repository called `dev.db` and things will be stored there, no need to install any technologies to get a database up and running!

#### Configuring Clerk

Clerk is our choice of authentication service for Noodle, it's true that it is a paid service but arguably for running a self hosted version of Noodle it is even easier then setting things up yourself especially with OAuth. To configure clerk you need to do the following:

1.  Create your account through [Clerk's dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/)

2.  Add a new application

3.  Set up it's name and how you wish to sign in

4.  In the sidebar, go to "API Keys"

5.  Copy the publishable key into `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` in your .env file

6.  Copy the secret key into `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` in your .env file

And now you got Auth!

#### Configuring Upstash

1. Create your account through [Upstash's dashboard](https://console.upstash.com)
2. Click on "Create database"
3. Give it a name and a region
4. Enable TLS (SSL) encryption
5. Press create
6. In the "Connect to your database" section, select "@upstash/redis"
7. Copy the url into your `.env` file as `REDIS_URL` key
8. Copy the token into your `.env` file as `REDIS_TOKEN` key

And that's all for the redis part!

### Installing dependencies

To install the dependencies needed to run Noodle, you need to run `pnpm install`, this will install all of the packages that we use. After this is done, you are ready to run Noodle locally!

### Running stuff

```bash
# Run the project's dev server
pnpm dev

# Build the project
pnpm build

# Run the built project in production mode
pnpm start

# Lint
pnpm lint

# Format
pnpm format:write
```
